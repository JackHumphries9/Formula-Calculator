<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

This project is a small assignment I was given during my time studying GCSE Computer Science. The task was to make a Formula Calculator and have it calculate a few formulas. I decided to use the Tkinter python module to create a full GUI application. The application works really well, allowing you to calculate many different values including speed, force, weight and momentum. I even added functionality to insert certain values, such as the grativational constant.


### Built With

* [Python](https://python.org)
* [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

### Installation
You need Python 3 installed to run this. Python 2 is not supported.

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/JackHumphries9/formula-calculator.git
```

EXTRA STEP FOR LINUX:
If you are on Linux, you may need to install tkinter using the package manager. On debian based systems do:
```
sudo apt install python-tk
```

2. Run the code
```
cd formula-calculator && python3 main.py
```
